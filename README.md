# Firebase Shared Drawing

This iOS app demonstrates the use of the Firebase SDK to create a shared drawing
canvas. Multiple users can run the app and draw on the same canvas. Line
segments are synchronized as the user draws them. It is compatible with the
[Android drawing app](https://github.com/firebase/AndroidDrawing/).

The color picker uses the [NKO Color
Picker](https://github.com/FWCarlos/NKO-Color-Picker-View-iOS)

To download and setup all necessary SDKs, please run `setup.sh`.

This example is intended to demonstrate how you can adapt single-user
applications to be collaborative with the help of Firebase. Create your own
Firebase and incorporate these techniques into your own application!
